# RepeatProject

**Title:** My Favourite Footballers<br>
**Name:** Declan Moran<br>
**Student ID:** G00372047<br>

## Application Function
My project is very similar to the Student Manager applictaion we worked on through out the year. I used this to gauarntee I achieved the basic functionality. It includes the 7 methods required all working perfectly. The JavaFX GUI required is also working perfectly with a quit option available to close it. The code contains many comments throughout and is indented consistently. it has aslo been double checked for any spelling errors. There are however a few issues with the submission. The consistent submissions are missing due to my procrastinating in completeing the assignment. 

## Roadblocks and Unfinished Functionality
I aslo had many problems with GitHub and Eclipse throughout. I firstly could not clone the repository given to Eclipse as it would keep asking for a Username and Password. Everytime I would type it in correctly it would keep popping up with this box. Ispent hours looking for solutions online and tried many things but could never get it fixed. It eventually let me create my own GitHub repository and clone this to Eclipse however whenever I tried to commit and push from Eclipse to GitHub I would get this username/password box keep popping up again and once again couldnt get a fix. I had to just create the code on Eclipse, run it to see if it worked and fixed any errors and eventually when i was finished copy and paste the code into the GitHub repository. I know that if I had just started the assignment earlier I couldve seen this well in advance and hopefully got a fix but it was extremely frustrating to spend all that time trying to get a fix.
